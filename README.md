# Dubai-Housing-Market-Data-Analysis
An interactive Power BI dashboard using Dubai housing market data to provide actionable insights.

## ‚úÖ **Brief Summary:**
Built an interactive dashboard in Power BI to analyze Dubai housing data based on size, price, location, and features. Used DAX and Power Query to clean data, categorize listings, and create visuals to support real estate decision-making.

## üßæ**Problem Statement:**
Real estate professionals often struggle with interpreting large datasets to identify trends in pricing, property distribution, and market segmentation. The challenge lies in converting raw property listings into a clear, user-friendly dashboard that provides actionable insights.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tools Used:**
- Power BI Desktop
- DAX 
- Power Query

## üìà **Visualizations Created:**

- **KPI Cards:** To Show Total Properties, Average Price, Average Price per SqFt , Average Size (SqFt) , Most Expensive Property
- **Line Chart:** To analyze a trend of average price over the years (Property Built).
- **Stacked Column chart:** To show properties distribution across neighborhood by Property Agee on x - axis.
- **Pie Chart:** To show proportions of Properties by Categories like Budget, Mid-range and High-End.
- **Treemap:** To show Average Price by Neighborhoods like Urban, Rural or Suburb.
- **Scatter Plot (Binned):** To visualize trend of Average Price vs Property Size with size bins to avoid clutter.
- **Matrix:** To provide raw data for deeper inspection on count of properties per categories and neighborhoods.
- **Slicers:**  To enable dynamic filtering by Number Bedrooms and Bathrooms and Year Built.
